\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we give a positive answer to a recent open problem---is there a categorical interpretation of the Gödel-Löb axiom~$\Box (\Box A \to A) \to \Box A$ which refutes the completeness principle $A \to \Box A$?
  We consider the $\PP$-category $\ASM(\Lambda)$ of assemblies on untyped $\lambda$-calculus and trackable maps with an exposure-like construction $\Box\colon \ASM(\Lambda) \looparrowright \ASM(\Lambda)$, internal to a guarded homotopy type theory, as the interpretation of the provability modality~$\Box$.
  We show that $\Box$ refutes the reflection principle $\Box A \to A$ and the completeness principle but proves the Gödel-Löb axiom.
  Of the utmost significance of the interpretation for $\Box A$ is that its denotation involves not only intensions, e.g., derivations of a proof, code of programs, or $\lambda$-terms modulo $\alpha$-equivalence given its provability reading but also their extensions enriched with the notion of time steps. 
  Apart from its own theoretical interest, following the intuitive understanding of $\Box A$ as a type of typed code \`a la Davies and Pfenning, our work is a step towards extending type theories on which proof assistants are based with non-structural but guarded recursion for typed code in a logically consistent way.

\section{\texorpdfstring{$\PP$}{P}-category of assemblies on \texorpdfstring{$\lambda$}{λ}-calculus}\label{sec:assemblies}
In this section, we introduce the $\PP$-category of assemblies on $\lambda$-calculus and trackable maps.
Assemblies are used to accommodate the information of how extensions are related to, or \emph{realised by}, intensions. Accordingly an appropriate notion of morphisms between assemblies is introduced to form a $\PP$-category, laying
the technical foundation of our interpretation of modalities discussed in~\Cref{sec:provability}.


\paragraph*{Assembly}
An assembly on natural numbers is a set $|X|$ with a realisability relation $\mathord{\Vdash} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \times |X|$ such that for every $x$ there exists some $a$ with $a \Vdash x$. We say that $a$ \emph{realises} $x$ or $a$ is a \emph{realiser} of $x$ if $n \Vdash x$.
The notion of assemblies is nowadays often defined on a partial applicative structure $(A, \cdot)$ satisfying combinatory completeness, i.e.\ a partial combinatory algebra~\cite{Oosten2008}, PCA for short.
Our definition below is, apart from being type-theoretic, not an instance of the definition based on a PCA.
\begin{definition}\label{def:assembly}
  An \emph{assembly} $X$ on $\lambda$-calculus consists of a \emph{carrier} type $|X| : \Univ$ and a \emph{realisability} relation ${\Vdash_X}$ from $\Lambda_0$ to $|X|$ such that
  \emph{(a)} every $x : |X|$ merely has a term $M : \Lambda_0$ with $M \Vdash_X x$;
  \emph{(b)} $M \Vdash_X x$ whenever $M \reduce N$ and $N \Vdash_X x$.
  To put it formally, an assembly is a quadruple $(|X|, \Vdash_X, r_X, t_X)$ of type
  \[
    \Asm_0(\Lambda) \defeq \sum_{|X| : \Univ}\;\sum_{\mathord{\Vdash_X}:\Lambda_0 \to |X| \to \Univ} 
    \left(\mathord{\Vdash_X}\;\mathsf{respects}\;\mathord{\reduce}\right)
      \times \mathsf{isRightTotal}({\Vdash_X})
  \]
  where
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item $\left(\mathord{\Vdash_X}\;\mathsf{respects}\;\mathord{\twoheadrightarrow_\beta}\right)$ is defined as $\prod_{M N : \Lambda_0} \prod_{x : |X|} \left( \left(M \twoheadrightarrow_ \beta N\right) \to N \Vdash x \to M \Vdash x \right) $, and

    \item $\mathsf{isRightTotal}(\Vdash_X)$ is a proposition defined as $\forall (x : |X|).\, \exists (M : \Lambda_0).\, M \Vdash x$.
  \end{romanenumerate}
\end{definition}

The required properties of \Cref{def:assembly} depart from the definition based on a PCA as follows. 
First, we do not require the type $M \Vdash_X x$ to be a proposition (contrary to its topos-theoretic formulation~\cite{Birkedal2002a}).
Although this additional requirement simplifies many constructions later, it is not necessary to derive our main results.
Second, as we would like to account for intensional equality in addition to extensional equality between terms,
we cannot identify $\beta$-equivalent terms \emph{a priori}.
As a result, the interaction with reduction $\reduce$ is formulated as an additional property of~$\Vdash$. 
%The formulation $\left(\mathord{\Vdash_X}\;\mathsf{respects}\;\mathord{\twoheadrightarrow_\beta}\right)$ is motivated by the confluence of $\lambda$-calculus where every two $\beta$-equivalent terms $M_i$ have a confluent term $N$, i.e.\ $M_i \reduce N$ for $i = 1, 2$.
This formulation also agrees with the one on an ordered PCA~\cite[Section~2.3]{Hofstra2003}.
Third, a plausible alternative to the right totality is
\[
  \prod (x : |X|).\, \sum (M : \Lambda_0).\, M \Vdash x
\]
stating that each $x : |X|$ has an explicit choice of realisers.
%This is not reasonable if, say, $|X|$ is a function type since it amounts to giving a standard implementation in $\lambda$-calculus for any realisable function $f$.
Indeed, with functional extensionality which holds in homotopy type theory, any inhabitant of the alternative formulation leads to a \emph{contradiction}~\cite{Troelstra1977}. \ltnote{check this}

\begin{example}\label{ex:assembly-lambda}
  The type $\Lambda_0$ of closed terms with ${\reduce} : \Lambda_0 \to \Lambda_0 \to \Univ$ as its realisability relation is an assembly $(\Lambda_0, \reduce, r_\Lambda, t_\Lambda)$ which plays a significant role in \Cref{thm:S4-no-quoting} where $r_\Lambda$ and $t_\Lambda$ are given by the transitivity and the reflexivity of~$\reduce$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  The assembly of natural numbers is also important but not in this paper.
  Nevertheless, we define a realisability relation $\Vdash_{\Nat}$ for natural numbers by
  \[
    M \Vdash_\Nat n \defeq M \reduce \mathtt{c}_n
  \]
  where $\mathtt{c}_n$ is the Church encoding of a natural number $n : \Nat$ with $r_\Nat$ and $t_\Nat$ easy to define. 
\end{example}

\paragraph*{Trackable map}%

A morphism between assemblies on a PCA $(A, \cdot)$ is typically defined as a function~$f$ (merely) tracked by some $b \in A$ in the sense that there (merely) exists some $b$ such that $b \cdot a \Vdash f\,x$ whenever $a \Vdash x$.
In this case, $b$ is called the \emph{tracker} of $f$, or equivalently, $f$ is said to be tracked by $b$.
It is noted by Kavvos~\cite{Kavvos2017b} that to reconcile intensionality we have to consider the tracker as part of structure instead of its mere existence.
\begin{definition}\label{def:trackable}
  Given assemblies $X$ and $Y$, a \emph{trackable map} from $X$ to $Y$ consists of a function $\bproj{f}$ from $|X|$ to $|Y|$ and a term $F$ with at most a free variable $\mathtt{x}$ such that $F[M/\mathtt{x}] \Vdash \bproj{f}\,x$ whenever $M \Vdash x$.
  In other words, a trackable map is an inhabitant of $\Asm_1(X, Y) \defeq \sum_{\bproj{f} : |X| \to |Y|} \sum_{F : \Lambda_1} \mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, \bproj{f})$ where
  \[
    \mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, \bproj{f}) \defeq \prod_{M : \Lambda_0} \prod_{x : |X|}
    \left( M \Vdash_X x \to F[M/\mathtt{x}] \Vdash_Y \bproj{f}\, x \right).
  \]
  Likewise, a \emph{merely trackable map} is an inhabitant of $\sum_{\bproj{f} : |X| \to |Y|} \exists_{F : \Lambda_1}\mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, \bproj{f})$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{notation*}
  In the following context, we write $F[M]$ instead of $F[M/\mathtt{x}]$ if there is no danger of confusion since each $F$ has at most one free variable.
\end{notation*}
By definition, a trackable map $f$ actually consists of not only a function $\bproj{f}$ between carriers but also its tracker $F$ and a transformation $\mathfrak{f}$ for realisability.

\begin{example}[Identity]
  Every assembly $X$ has a trackable map
  \[
    \iid_X \defeq (\id_{|X|}, \mathtt{x}, \pr_3)
    \quad\text{where}\quad
  \pr_3 \defeq \lambda M\,x\,r.\, r : \prod_{M : \Lambda_0} \prod_{x : |X|} \left( M \Vdash_X x \to M  \Vdash_X x  \right)
  \]
  since $\mathtt{x}[M]$ is judgementally equal to $M$.
\end{example}

Now we proceed with defining the composition of trackable maps. Consider the term substitution $(G, F)
\mapsto G [ F ]$ thought as (intensional) function composition, since there is a path $p : G[F[M]] =_{\Lambda_0} G[F] [M]$ for any term $M$.
Given $r : M \Vdash_X x$, the type of $\mathfrak{g}(\mathfrak{f}\,r)$ is $G[F[M]]$ and thus its transportation along $p$ has type $G[F][M]$.
This defines an operation $\lambda M.\,\lambda x.\,\lambda r.\, \mathsf{transport}(p, \mathfrak{g}(\mathfrak{f}\,r))$.
Then, it follows that the function composition and aforementioned operations amount to an operation $(g, f) \mapsto g \circ f$ of type
\[
  \prod_{X, Y, Z : \Asm_0(\Lambda)} \Asm_1(Y, Z) \to \Asm_1(X, Y) \to \Asm_1(X, Z)
\]
for trackable maps. It is not hard to see that $f \circ \id = f$ and $\id \circ f = f$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:category-of-assemblies}
  The type $\Asm_0(\Lambda)$ of assemblies and the family of types $\Asm_1(X, Y)$ of trackable maps indexed by $X, Y$ with the composition $\circ$ for trackable maps and identities $\id$ form a category denoted by $\Asm(\Lambda)$.
\end{proposition}

%We may also consider reductions $F_1 \reduce F_2$ between morphisms $(f_1, F_1, \mathfrak{f}_1)$
%and $(f_2, F_2, \mathfrak{f}_2)$ as two cells since $F_1 \reduce F_2$ implies $F_1[M] \reduce F_2[M]$.
%That is, we do have a $2$-category of assemblies in the spirit of Seely's $2$-categorical model~\cite{Seely1987}.
%This line of research is out of scope of this paper, so we refrain ourselves from further discussion. 


\paragraph*{Extensional equality and \texorpdfstring{$\PP$}{P}-category of assemblies}

Now we define the (partial) equivalence relation $\sim$ referred as the \emph{extensional equality} on trackable maps by $f_1 \sim f_2$ if $\bproj{f_1} = \bproj{f_2}$.
It is not hard to see that $\Asm(\Lambda)$ with the equivalence relation $\sim$ is a $\PP$-category, denoted by $\ASM(\Lambda)$. 
We now investigate some of its basic properties.

\begin{example}[Terminal object]
  The unit assembly $\top$ is a $\PP$-terminal object defined as $(\Unit, \Vdash_{\Unit}, r_{\Unit}, t_{\Unit})$ where 
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item $\Unit$ is the unit type,  
    \item $\Vdash_{\Unit}$ a relation defined by $M \Vdash_{\Unit} \star \defeq M \reduce \mathtt{\lambda x.\, x}$, 
    \item $r_{\Unit}: (M \reduce N) \to (N \reduce L) \to (M \reduce L)$ given by the transitivity of the reduction relation $\reduce$,
    \item and $t_{\Unit}$ the fact that the only inhabitant $\star : \Unit$ has a realiser $\mathtt{\lambda x.\, x}$ (by reflexivity).
  \end{romanenumerate}
  The finality follows from the function extensionality.
\end{example}

Every inhabitant of (the carrier of) an assembly $X$ corresponds to a merely trackable map from $\top$ to $X$.
Moreover, distinct merely trackable maps can be separated by global elements in the category of assemblies and merely trackable maps. 
Accordingly, in~$\ASM(\Lambda)$, as the tracker~$F$ is part of a trackable map $(\bproj{f}, F, \mathfrak{f})$, we can construct a global element for any inhabitant $x : \bproj{X}$ if we know how $x$ is realised. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:global-elemnt}
  Let $X$ be an assembly. Then the following statements hold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Every inhabitant $x_0 : \bproj{X}$ corresponds to a merely trackable map from $\top$ to $X$.
    \item Every pair of $x_0 : \bproj{X}$ and $M : \Lambda_0$ with $r_0 : M \Vdash_X x$ defines a global element of $X$, i.e.\ a trackable map from $\top$ to $X$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

One may expect that the terminal object $\top$ in~$\ASM(\Lambda)$ should still be a separator with respect to the extensional equality~$\sim$ in the sense that $f_1 \sim f_2$ if $f_1 \circ x \sim f_2 \circ x$ for every global element~$x$ of $X$.
However, due to the existence of non-trivial higher paths, the general case is a rather subtle issue~\cite{Kraus2015}. 
Nevertheless, it is indeed the case as expected if the codomain of a trackable map is a set. 
\begin{proposition}
  Every pair of trackable maps $f_1, f_2 : X \to Y$ where the carrier $\bproj{Y}$ is a set are extensionally equal if $f_1 \circ x \sim f_2 \circ x$ for every global element $x$ to $X$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  By function extensionality, it suffices to define a trackable map $(\mathsf{c}_x, M_x, \mathfrak{M}_x)$ from $\top$ to $X$ for any inhabitant $x : \bproj{X}$, where $\mathsf{c}_x(\star) = x$.
  Then, we show that there is a path $f_1\,x = f_2\,x$ independent of the choice of $M_x$ and $\mathfrak{M}_x$, by the right totality $t_X$, the recursion principle of propositional truncation, and the assumption that the path type $f_1\,x = f_2\,x$ is contractible. 
\end{proof}

It is straightforward but tedious to define the $\PP$-product of assemblies, so we leave this as an exercise to the reader. 
\begin{example}[Initial object]
The empty assembly $\bot$ is $\PP$-initial consisting of the empty type $\Empty$ and a relation $\Vdash_\bot : \Lambda_0 \to \Empty \to \Univ$ given by the elimination rule for the empty type.
The other two components $r_\Empty$ and $t_\Empty$ are trivial.
\end{example}

In addition, one can show that $\bot$ is even a \emph{strict} initial object. That is, 
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:strict-initial}
  Any trackable map from some assembly $X$ to $\bot$ is a $\PP$-isomorphism. 
\end{proposition}
The strictness of $\bot$ follows easily from that for any type $X$ with a function $X \to \Empty$ one can show the equivalence $\eqv{\Empty}{X}$ in homotopy type theory.
From the strictness of the initial object, no morphism from $\top$ to $\bot$ could exist, since $\top$ is not equivalent to $\bot$.

The construction of exponential $X \Rightarrow Y$ is a bit intriguing.
With the definition of trackable maps, we may expect the exponential assembly $X \Rightarrow Y$ to consist of trackable maps.
However, the exponential assembly $X \Rightarrow Y$ has the type of \emph{merely} trackable maps as its carrier~\cite{Kavvos2017b}, since the carrier is meant to be the type of extensions of trackable maps.
\begin{example}[Exponential]
  Given assemblies $X$ and $Y$, define
  \begin{align*}
    \barred{X \Rightarrow Y} & \defeq \sum_{f : |X| \to |Y|} \exists (F : \Lambda_1).\, \mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, f) \equiv \sum_{f : |X| \to |Y|} \brck{\sum_{F : \Lambda_1} \mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, f) }
  \end{align*}
  with the realisability relation 
  \[
    L \Vdash_{X \Rightarrow Y} (f, \star) \defeq \prod_{M : \Lambda_0} \prod_{x : |X|}\left( M \Vdash_X x \to L\,M \Vdash_Y f\,x\right).
  \]
  It remains to construct $r_{X\Rightarrow Y}$ and $t_{X \Rightarrow Y}$. 
  We know that $L' \reduce L$ implies $L'\,M \reduce L\,M$ by the congruence rule, so $L'$ realises $(f, \star)$ whenever $L$ realises $(f, \star)$ and $L' \reduce L$ by $r_Y$.
  For every $(f, \star) : |X \Rightarrow Y|$, there merely exists a tracker $F$ of $f$.
  We can show that $L \defeq \left(\mathtt{\lambda x}.\,F\right)$ realises $(f, \star)$, since
  $\left(\mathtt{\lambda x}.\,F\right)\,M \onereduce F[M]$ for any $M$ and $F[M] \Vdash_Y f\,x$ whenever $M \Vdash x$
  by that fact that $F$ is a tracker of $f$.
  Then, we apply the recursion principle of the truncated type $\brck{\sum_{F : \Lambda_1} \mathsf{Tracks}_{X, Y}(F, f) }$ on the second component of $(f, \star)$ to show the mere existence of a realiser of $(f, \star)$, i.e.\ an inhabitant $t_{X \Rightarrow Y}$ of the right totality.

  \ltnote{show that $X\Rightarrow Y$ has the required universal property formally.}
\end{example}

To sum up, we have just showed that $\ASM(\Lambda)$ has a strict initial object, finite products, and exponentials.
That is, 
\begin{corollary}
  $\ASM(\Lambda)$ is a cartesian closed $\PP$-category with a strict initial object.
\end{corollary}
\ltnote{shall we show that $\ASM(\Lambda)$ has a natural number object?}

\section{Realisability semantics for two modalities}\label{sec:provability}

In this section, we first introduce a comonadic exposure $\boxtimes\colon \ASM(\Lambda) \looparrowright \ASM(\Lambda)$ which models a $S4$ modality but different from the exposure $\boxtimes_K$ previously introduced~\cite[Section~9.1]{Kavvos2017b}.
For example, $\boxtimes_K$ preserves finite products including the terminal object~$\top$, but ours does not with good reason. 
Most importantly, we are able to refute the completeness principle $X \to \boxtimes X$ understood as a quoting function from the computational perspective, while we did not find a way to refute it using $\boxtimes_K$.
Hitherto, we complete our cook's tour of the previous set-theoretic results based on a partial combinatory algebra in homotopy type theory.

Thereafter, we use an extension of cubical type theory---Clocked Cubical Type Theory~\cite{Bahr2017,Kristensen2021}---and introduce an exposure-like construction $\Box$ to model the provability modality.
This construction exploits Nakano's later modality so that the intuitive meaning of $\Box X$ can be expressed cleanly.
We will show that $\Box$ refutes not only the completeness principle by the same argument for $\boxtimes$ but also the reflection principle $\Box X \to X$ which is valid for $\boxtimes$ but logically inconsistent with Gödel-Löb axiom.
Finally, we establish one of the main contribution of this paper: given a trackable map $f : \Box X \to X$ tracked by~$F$ there is an inhabitant of $\Box X$ realised by~$F[\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}]$
where $\mathsf{fix}\,F$ is the fixpoint given by the Second Recursion Theorem.
Then, the categorical form of the Gödel-Löb axiom in $\ASM(\Lambda)$ follows.

\subsection{A comonadic exposure for \texorpdfstring{$\mathsf{S4}$}{S4} modality}
An assembly $X$ records the interplay between intensions, i.e.\ untyped $\lambda$-terms, and extensions, so it is possible to bring out intensions to the level of extensions by pairing $x : \barred{X}$ with a term $M$ which merely realises $x$ as the carrier of $\boxtimes X$.
A pair $(M, x)$ with $\star : \brck{M \Vdash_X x}$ should be thought as the extension $x$ along with its \emph{extensional} representation~$M$.  
Thus, we argue that $(M, x, \star)$ shall be realised by terms which are $\beta$-equivalent to its Gödel encoding $\qquote{M}$ (instead of $M$ as proposed by Kavvos), since terms $N$ with $N \reduce \qquote{M}$ are \emph{intensional} representations of $M$.
In short, the carrier and the realisability relation are defined as
\[
  \barred{\boxtimes X} \defeq \sum_{M : \Lambda_0} \sum_{x : \barred{X}} \brck{M \Vdash x}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  N \Vdash_{\boxtimes X} (M, x, \star) \defeq N \reduce \qquote{M}
\]
respectively.
It turns out that $\boxtimes X \defeq (\barred{\boxtimes X}, \Vdash_{\boxtimes X}, r_{\boxtimes X}, t_{\boxtimes X})$ is indeed an assembly where $r_{\boxtimes X}$ and $t_{\boxtimes X}$ are the transitivity and the reflexivity of $\reduce$.

As for the mapping on morphisms, consider any trackable map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$.
We define $\boxtimes f \defeq (\bproj{f}^\boxtimes, F^\boxtimes, \mathfrak{f}^\boxtimes)\colon \boxtimes X \to \boxtimes Y$ as follows.
Recall that the propositional truncation $\brck{\blank}$ is functorial, so
\[
  \bproj{f}^\boxtimes (M, x, \star) \defeq (F[M], \bproj{f}\,x, \brck{\mathfrak{f}\,M\,x}\,\star)
\]
is a function from $\barred{\boxtimes X}$ to $\barred{\boxtimes Y}$.
To give a tracker of $f^\boxtimes$, recall from \Cref{sec:preliminaries} that there is a term $\mathtt{subst}$ performing term substitution on Gödel numbers, so the term $F^\boxtimes \defeq \mathtt{subst}\,\qquote{F}\,\mathtt{x}$ tracks $f^\boxtimes$ since we have
\begin{align*}
  \left(\mathtt{subst} \,\qquote{F}\,\mathtt{x}\right)[N/\mathtt{x}]
  \equiv  {} & \mathtt{subst}\,\qquote{F}\,N \\
  \reduce {} & \mathtt{subst}\,\qquote{F}\,\qquote{M} \\
  \reduce {} & \qquote{F[M]} \Vdash_{\boxtimes Y} f^\boxtimes(M, x, \star)
\end{align*}
completing the definition of $\mathfrak{f}^\boxtimes$.
In short, $\boxtimes(f, F, \mathfrak{f}) \defeq(f^\boxtimes, F^\boxtimes, \mathfrak{f}^\boxtimes)$ is a trackable map.
\begin{theorem}[{cf.~\cite[Theorem~11]{Kavvos2017b}}]\label{thm:S4-exposure}
  $\boxtimes\colon \ASM(\Lambda) \looparrowright \ASM(\Lambda)$ is an exposure.
  Moreover, $\boxtimes$ has a comonadic structure given by families of trackable maps
  \begin{romanenumerate}
    \item the counit $\epsilon_A \colon \boxtimes X \to X$
    \item the comultiplication $\delta_A \colon \boxtimes X \to \boxtimes \boxtimes X$
  \end{romanenumerate}
  natural in $X$. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  We only sketch the proof of three less obvious statements here---the preservation of identities and the construction of natural transformations $\epsilon\colon \boxtimes \to \mathcal{I}_{\ASM(\Lambda)}$ and $\delta\colon \boxtimes \to \boxtimes\boxtimes$. 
  To show that $\boxtimes$ preserves identities, we use that fact that the propositional truncation $\brck{\blank}$ is a functor which preserves identities and that $\pr_3$ is a third projection.
  Then, it follows that $\brck{\pr_3\,M\,x} \equiv \brck{\id} = \id$ and thus $\id_{\barred{X}}^\boxtimes (M, x, \star) \equiv (\mathtt{x}[M], x, \brck{\pr_3\,M\,x}\,\star) \equiv \id_{\barred{\boxtimes X}}$.

  For the families of maps $\boxtimes A \to A$ and $\boxtimes A \to \boxtimes \boxtimes A$ natural in $A$, recall from \Cref{sec:preliminaries} that there are terms $\Eval$ and $\Quote$ which evaluates a Gödel number to its representing term and computes the Gödel number $\qquote{N}$ of a given term~$N \equiv \qquote{M}$ in the form of Gödel number respectively. That is, 
  \[
    \mathtt{eval}\,\qquote{M} \reduce M
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \mathtt{quote}\,\qquote{M} \reduce \qquote{\qquote{M}}.
  \]
It is now straightforward to define the required natural transformations between exposures.
\end{proof}
In particular, the counit $\epsilon_X\colon \Box X \to X$ is understood as the evaluation of the intension $M$ to its extension~$x$, as justified by the its tracker~$\mathtt{eval}$. 

\begin{remark}
\ltnote[inline,nomargin]{$\boxtimes$ is not cartesian and not product-preserving.}
\end{remark}

The following theorem is another difference between $\boxtimes_K$ and $\boxtimes$.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:S4-no-quoting}
  There is no natural transformation $\eta\colon  \mathcal{I}_{\ASM(\Lambda)} \to \boxtimes$.
\end{theorem}
We show the existence of such a natural transformation implies the existence of a term $\mathsf{quote}'$ with $\mathsf{quote}'[M] \reduce \qquote{M}$ using naturality and the fact that $\Lambda_0$ itself has naturally an assembly structure (\Cref{ex:assembly-lambda}), but however $\Quote'$ cannot exist.
\begin{proof}
  Assume that such a family of maps $\eta_X\colon X \to \boxtimes X$ natural in $X$ exist.
  Every closed term $M_0$ corresponds to a trackable map $\widehat{M_0} \defeq (\mathsf{c}_{M_0}, M_0, \mathfrak{M}_0) \colon \top \to \Lambda$ where $\mathsf{c}_{M_0}$ is the constant function with the value $M_0$ and $\mathfrak{M}_0$ is also the constant function with the value $\mathsf{refl}_{\twoheadrightarrow} M_0 : M_0 \reduce M_0$.
  Consider the naturality of $\eta$
  \[
    \xymatrix{
      \top \ar[r]^{\eta_\top} \ar[d]_{\widehat{M_0}} & \boxtimes \ar[d]^{\boxtimes \widehat{M_0}} \top \\
      \Lambda \ar[r]_{\eta_\Lambda} & \boxtimes \Lambda
    }
  \]
  which commutes up to $\sim$, namely, ${\eta_\Lambda \circ \widehat{M_0}} \sim {\boxtimes \widehat{M_0} \circ \eta_\top}$.
  Note that $\boxtimes \widehat{M_0}$ maps arbitrary inhabitant of $\boxtimes \top$ to $(M_0, M_0, \bproj{\mathsf{refl}_{\twoheadrightarrow}M_0})$ so that $\bproj{\eta}$ must satisfy 
\[
  \bproj{\eta_\Lambda}\,M_0 \equiv \left(\bproj{\eta_\Lambda} \circ \widehat{M_0}\right)\,\star = \left(\boxtimes \widehat{M_0} \circ \eta_\top \right)\,\star \equiv (M_0, M_0, \bproj{\mathsf{refl}_{\twoheadrightarrow}M_0}).
\]
By assumption, $\eta_\Lambda$ is tracked by some term, say $\mathtt{quote}'$, such that $\mathtt{quote}'[N] \reduce \qquote{M}$ whenever $N \reduce M$.
However, it implies that $\mathtt{quote}'[M] \reduce \qquote{M}$ for any $M$, a contraction.
\end{proof}

\ltnote{can $\mathcal{I} \to \boxtimes_K$ be refutable?}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:S4-modality}
Recall the modal type theory considered by Davies and Pfenning~\cite{Davies2001b} where a dual-context modal type theory is introduced to extend simple type theory with a $S4$ modality $\Box$, a construct $\mathtt{box}$, a $\mathtt{let}$-expression for boxed terms, and typing rules below.
\[
\begin{minipage}{.47\linewidth}
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Delta; \cdot \vdash E : A$}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Delta; \Gamma \vdash \mathtt{box}\,E:\Box A$}
  \end{prooftree}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{0.47\linewidth}
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Delta; \Gamma \vdash E_1 : \Box A$}
    \AxiomC{$\Delta, u : A; \Gamma \vdash E_2 : B$}
  \BinaryInfC{$\Delta; \Gamma \vdash \mathtt{let}\,\mathtt{box}\, u = E_1\, \mathtt{in}\,E_2 : B$}
  \end{prooftree}
\end{minipage}
\]
Following \Cref{thm:S4-exposure,thm:S4-no-quoting}, we anticipate an interpretation of $\Box$ to justify the `omitted congruence rule` for the $\mathtt{box}$ construct~\cite[Section~2.5]{Davies2001b} and the absence of quoting function $A \to \Box A$ for their system respectively.
\end{remark}

\subsection{An exposure for \texorpdfstring{$\mathsf{GL}$}{GL} modality}
It is known that the Gödel-Löb axiom $\Box(\Box A \to A) \to \Box A$ is incompatible with the reflection principle $\Box A \to A$.
Indeed, let $A$ be the falsity $\bot$ for both laws. Then, we have
\[
  \Box(\Box \bot \to \bot) \to \bot
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  \Box \bot \to \bot
\]
By the necessitation rule and modus ponens, $\Box (\Box \bot \to \bot)$ as well as $\bot$ are derivable.
Yet, by \Cref{prop:strict-initial,thm:S4-exposure}, we cannot expect the exposure $\boxtimes$ to model the Gödel-Löb axiom.
Mysteriously, the provability modality $\Box$ and the Gödel-Löb axiom are suggested to be understood also as the type of code of type~$A$ (cf.~\Cref{remark:S4-modality}) and as \emph{intensional recursion} respectively from the computational perspective~\cite{Kavvos2017b}, if one is willing to give up consistency.
This trade-off, however, is not possible in this semantics approach.

To untie the knot but to retain the interpretation of $\Box A$ as code of type~$A$, we refine our interpretation with the notion of \emph{computation stages}. 
Considering the counit $\epsilon_X\colon \boxtimes X \to X$, it is possible to evaluate $(M, x, \star)$ because the code is already available for doing so.
And, the provability reading of $\Box$ suggests that inhabitants of $\Box X$ are not available now but in the later stage.
To express this idea cleanly, we work in an extension of homotopy type theory with the support of Nakano's later modality~\cite{Nakano2000}.

\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[Clocked exposure]
\end{definition}

\paragraph*{Back to \texorpdfstring{$\mathsf{GL}$}{GL}}

Now we introduce the clocked exposure $\Box^\kappa \colon \ASM(\Lambda) \to \ASM(\Lambda)$ modelling the $\mathsf{GL}$ modality as follows. 
For any assembly $X$, the carrier of $\Box^\kappa X$ and the realisability relation are now defined as
\[
  \bproj{\Box^\kappa X} \defeq \sum_{M : \Lambda_0} \sum_{x : {\rhd^\kappa \bproj{X}}} \rhd (\alpha : \kappa) .\, \brck{M \Vdash_X x [\alpha]}
  \quad\text{and}\quad
  N \Vdash_{\Box^\kappa X} (M, x, \star) \defeq N \reduce \qquote{M}
\]
where $\rhd (\alpha : \mathbb{T}) .\, \brck{M \Vdash_X x [\alpha]}$ is a proposition by~\Cref{lem:proposition-closed-under-later} and the relation $\Vdash_{\Box^\kappa X}$ is defined as the same as the comonadic exposure~$\boxtimes$.
The only difference between carriers $\bproj{\Box^\kappa X}$ and $\bproj{\boxtimes X}$ is the extensional part which becomes $\rhd^\kappa \bproj{X}$ so that the extension of $(M, x, \star)$ is available in the next stage but not earlier (within the clock $\kappa$).
Similarly, $\Box^\kappa X \defeq (\bproj{\Box^\kappa X}, \Vdash_{\Box^\kappa X}, r_{\Box^\kappa X}, t_{\Box^\kappa X})$ is an assembly where $r_{\Box^\kappa X}$ and $t_{\Box^\kappa X}$ are given by the transitivity and the reflexivity of $\reduce$. 

\begin{notation*}
  To avoid clumsy notations, the superscript of $\Box^\kappa$ is suppressed when appropriate.
\end{notation*}

For any trackable map $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, also define $\Box f$ as the same as $\boxtimes f$ with the exception of the function $\bproj{\Box f}$ between carriers which are now involved with a later modality:
\[
  \bproj{\Box^\kappa f}(M, x, \star) \defeq (F[M], \rhd^\kappa \bproj{f}\, x, \lambda \alpha.\, \brck{\mathfrak{f}\,M\,x[\alpha]}\,{\star}[\alpha])
\]
where $(\rhd^\kappa f\, x)[\alpha]$ is judgementally equal to $f(x[\alpha])$, and $\rhd^\kappa \bproj{f} : \rhd^\kappa \bproj{X} \to \rhd^\kappa \bproj{Y}$ is given by the functoriality of the later modality~$\mathord{\rhd}^\kappa$.
The very same argument for $\boxtimes f$ shows that $\Box^\kappa f$ is indeed a trackable map from $\bproj{\Box^\kappa X}$ to $\bproj{\Box^\kappa Y}$.

It is straightforward to show that $\Box^\kappa$ is a clocked-exposure by \Cref{lem:later-identity}.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:GL-exposure}
  $\Box^\kappa \colon \ASM(\Lambda) \looparrowright \ASM(\Lambda)$ is a clocked-exposure.
\end{theorem}

Similar to~\Cref{thm:S4-no-quoting}, we can refute the existence of a family of trackable maps $\eta_X\colon X \to \Box X$ natural in $X$ by the non-existence of the term $\mathsf{quote}'$ noted in~\Cref{sec:preliminaries}.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:GL-no-quoting}
  There is no natural transformation $\eta\colon  \mathcal{I}_{\ASM(\Lambda)} \to \Box^\kappa$.
\end{theorem}


On the other hand, it is not possible to have a family of trackable maps $\epsilon_X$ from $\Box^\kappa X$ to $X$ natural in $X$, since the extension part of an inhabitant of $\Box^\kappa X$ can only be projected in a time step away from now.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:GL-no-eval}
  There is no natural transformation $\epsilon\colon \Box^\kappa \to \mathcal{I}_{\ASM(\Lambda)}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Assume that a natural transformation~$\epsilon$ exists, and in particular $\epsilon_\bot \colon \Box^\kappa \bot \to \bot$. 
  We will show that there is $\mathsf{bang}\colon \rhd \Empty \to \Empty$, so by guarded recursion $\mathsf{fix}\,\mathsf{bang} : \Empty$ is a contradiction.
  
  First, let $x$ be an inhabitant of $\rhd \Empty$. We aim at constructing an inhabitant $(M, x, \star_M)$ of
  \[
    \Box^\kappa \bot \equiv \sum_{M : \Lambda_0} \sum_{x : {\rhd \Empty}} \rhd (\alpha : \mathbb{T}) .\, \brck{M \Vdash_\bot x [\alpha]}
  \]
  so that the function $\bproj{\epsilon_\bot}$ from $\bproj{\Box^\kappa \bot}$ to $\bproj{\bot} \equiv \Empty$ can be applied.
  For arbitrary closed term $M$, say $\mathtt{\lambda x.\, x}$, we apply the recursion principle~$\mathsf{rec}_{\Empty}$ of the empty type to~$x$ after a time step, so 
  \[
    \star_M \defeq \lambda \alpha.\, \mathsf{rec}_{\Empty}\,\brck{M \Vdash_\bot x[\alpha]}\,x[\alpha]
  \]
  is an inhabitant of $\rhd (\alpha : \mathbb{T}) .\, \brck{M \Vdash_\bot x [\alpha]}$ and thus $(M, x, \star_M)$ is of type $\bproj{\Box^\kappa \bot}$. 
\end{proof}

The payoff for disallowing (run-time) evaluation is to be able to adopt guarded recursion for typed code.
From the logical perspective, it is the deductive form of Gödel-Löb axiom.

\begin{theorem}[Intensional recursion]\label{thm:GL-recursion}
  For arbitrary map $f \colon \Box^\kappa X \to X$ tracked by some $F$, there exists a global element of $\Box^\kappa X$ tracked by $F[ \qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F} ]$.
\end{theorem}
This theorem follows from the Löb induction and the fact that $\mathsf{fix}\,F$ is a fixpoint of $F$
where $\mathsf{fix}\,F$ is given the Second Recursion Theorem (\Cref{coro:variant-of-SRT}) that every term $F : \Lambda_1$ has a fixpoint  $\mathsf{fix}\,F$ such that $\mathsf{fix}\,F \reduce F [ \qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F} ]$.

\begin{proof}
  Let $f$ be a trackable map from $\Box^\kappa X$ to $X$.
  We prove this statement by Löb induction on a $\sum$-type (\Cref{coro:lob-induction-sum}). 
  That is, assuming 
  \[
    x : \rhd \bproj{X}
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    r : \rhd (\alpha : \kappa).\, F[ \qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F} ] \Vdash x [\alpha]
  \]
  we derive an inhabitant $y : \bproj{X}$ realised by $F[\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}]$ as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item First, we have $r' : \rhd (\alpha : \kappa).\, \mathsf{fix}\,F \Vdash x [\alpha]$ since the realisability relation $\Vdash$ respects reductions $\reduce$ and $\mathsf{fix}\,F$ reduces to $F[\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}]$. 
    \item Choose $y$ to be $\bproj{f}(\mathsf{fix}\,F, x, r')$ so that we derive
      \[
        \mathfrak{f} (\mathsf{refl}_{\twoheadrightarrow}\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}) : F[\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}] \Vdash \bproj{f}(\mathsf\,F, x, r')
      \]
      by the fact that $F$ tracks $\bproj{f}$ and the realisability $\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F} \Vdash_{\Box^\kappa X} (\mathsf{fix}\,F, x, r')$ is just $\qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F} \reduce \qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}$ which holds by reflexivity.
  \end{enumerate}
  By \Cref{lem:global-elemnt}, the inhabitant of $\sum_{x : \bproj{X}} F[ \qquote{\mathsf{fix}\,F}] \Vdash_X x$ gives rise to a global element of $X$, concluding our proof.
